# VIII - Coin
Soon, this miser will leave this plane; thus words writ down will convey this pain.
Bells toll while toiling, be bards and bane babes: the black is croning, the void doth wake.
Two sides: the higher, the finest of fame; the lesser, fuels fire, yearning for praise.
Two sides: the dire one yielding to flames; while silent ones streak through their solitude's maze.
Two sides: one mixture, an alloy cold-pained: pressed into service, handled by crazed,
Moulded from eons of metals past made,
Stardust and spectres now printed, stained.

How similar in service, the lens does take,
Faux-sided, yet same, same silence, same frame:
The same said of sires, their cores - melt-made,
Brimstone and fire turned coin to cage.
