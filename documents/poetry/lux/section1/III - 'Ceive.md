# III - 'Ceive
Metaphorical eyes,
Do stare with intent,
Scanning darkly for time well spent.

A turn to the right,
One imagined said compass,
The retinas reach for divine recompense.

One stumble too many,
One twist: too turned,
The cornea caught clouds of cries and hurt.

Now seared in the service,
Of sight for the seer,
Metaphorical lens etched with sadness: tears.
