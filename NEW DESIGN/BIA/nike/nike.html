								<p>This reports aims to dissect Nike Inc’s world-renown branding model, evaluating
								its successful e-business migration via two business lenses: the brand equity
								model and; the customer decision journey. After their definitions, their
								amalgamation will showcase their synergy – and Nike’s relationship with the
								wider world.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
					<div class="sectionHolder">
						<h2>2.0 INTRODUCTION</h2>
						
							<div class="sectionText">
								<p>To contextualise this report: according to DataReportal’s global report, the
								internet is explored by 64.4% of the world’s population (Kemp, 2023). The
								current marketing environment has thus seen a paradigm-shift from one-way to
								two-way, customer-centric communication (Seamedu, 2023):</p>

								<p class="sectionQuotation">
									<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
									in recent times, […] social media, and digital marketing have taken the
									forefront in marketing communication efforts
									<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
								</p>

								<p>The World Wide Web, Internet of Things and social networking have allowed
								unprecedented customer autonomy in the consumer industry – of which Nike
								capitalises upon (Huang, 2023b). Thence, Nike’s business strategy is thus:
								sports sponsorship and ambassadorship – to increase their reputability and
								image (Willigan, 2014).</p>

									<img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_3_3.png">  
									<div class="overlay">Figure 2b: Michael Johnson competing in Nike-branded attire</div> 
								</div>

								<p>In addition to context, psychology-based definitions must be defined (Keller,
								1993):</p>

								<p>
									<ul>
										<li> Brand identities describe any name, term, sign, symbol, or design, or
										combination of them which is intended to identify the goods and services of
										one seller</li>
										<li>The brand is the amalgam of such recognisable identities</li>
										<li>Memory is simply the brain’s information storage</li>
										<li>Recognition is the mental exposure to a stimuli and ability to discern it</li>
										<li>Recall is the ability to utilise memory to retrieve stored information</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<p>Finally, Nike’s business model can be scrutinised based on its market position:</p>



							</div>
						</div>
					<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
					<div class="sectionHolder">
							<h2>3.0 MODELS</h2>
							<div class="sectionText">
								<p>The employed models are the brand equity model and the customer decision
								journey.</p>

								<p>The brand equity model evaluates the perceived value of a specific brand via
								collective memory (Huang, 2023b). Equity denotes its ability to be positive or
								negative, with the latter facilitating slow growth, loss of revenue and financial
								turmoil.</p>

								<p>Brand equity has differing interpretations, so this report will proceed with
								Keller’s (Keller, 1993). Aaker provides a comprehensive definition of brand
								equity, with some concepts mirroring Keller’s. Aaker’s interpretation defines
								brand identities as (Aaker, 1991):</p>

								<p class="sectionQuotation">
									<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
									A set of brand assets and liabilities linked to a brand, its name and
									symbol that add or subtract from the value provided to a firm and/or to
									that firm’s customer
									<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
								</p>

								<div class="sectionFigure noEffects"> 
									<img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_4.png">  
									<div class="overlay">Figure 3: Aaker’s brand equity model (Source: Aaker, 1991)</div> 
								</div>

								<p>Proceeding with Keller’s model: brand awareness comprises both brand
								recognition and recall. Alongside this, brand associations are powerful identifiers
								that can impact one’s opinion. They comprise:</p>

								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>- Benefits, which can be: experiential – “what it’s like to use”; functional –
										“how do they serve their purpose” or; symbolic – “what social gain is
										provided”</li>

										<li>- Attitudes, which are salient beliefs about the brand in addition to critical
										evaluations of such</li>
									</ul>
								</p>



								<p>Brand association also includes attributes: physical features and uses of the
								product – split between: product attributes, the physical makeup of the brand’s
								items and; non-product attributes, such as packaging and pricing.</p>
								
								<p>Finally, secondary associations can be crafted by knowledge of a brand’s
								ownership, or via one’s experience seeing brand ambassadors utilising product.</p>
								
								<p>Majahan dictates numerous benefits of brand equity emphasis (Majahan et al.,
								1994):</p>

								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>Enhanced performance [and] market efficiency</li>
										<li>Longevity</li>
										<li>Extensibility</li>

									</ul>
								</p>


								<p>While this is the case, critical thinking can elucidate the model’s pitfalls. Today’s
								age of information has created an abstraction between consumers and brands,
								increasing the difficulty in crafting customer connections (Garg, 2021; Llopis,
								2014). In addition, brand equity is unsustainable without dedicated company
								teams, requiring resource allocation (i.e. Nike’s marketing department)
								(Willigan, 2014). Positive brand equity generation is an endeavour, especially
								due to the consumer attention-span shift (Llopis, 2014):</p>


								<p class="sectionQuotation">
									<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
									Consumers are no longer brand loyal. They may be loyal to the
									engagement experience that a particular brand offers
									<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
									<br>
								</p>



								<p>Thus, brand equity is costly, but beneficial.</p>

								<p>Its final critique is simply, its classification as a “model”: brand equity has
								numerous definitions and is not a unified marketing science; it is instead a
								methodology, employed to improve customer-relationship management
								(Feldwick, 1996).</p>


								<div class="sectionFigure noEffects"> 
									<img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_5.pdf">  
									<div class="overlay">Figure 4: Brand Equity model – based on Keller’s definition (Source: Keller, 1993)</div> 
									<br>
								</div>
								
								<p>The model can correctly identify weaknesses within a brand’s marketing
								strategy, but does not independently scrutinise the customer’s mental process
								during purchase (Huang, 2023b). Hence: McKinsey’s customer decision
								journey, is introduced (Elzinga et al., 2009).</p>

								<p>The customer decision journey updates and abstracts the “traditional” funnel
								model for decision-making; elucidating a cyclical customer process - by which
								customers re-engage with brands when deciding which to purchase from
								(Elzinga et al., 2009).	</p>

								<div class="sectionFigure noEffects"> 
									<img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_6.png">  
									<div class="overlay">Figure 5: The customer decision journey (Source: Elzinga et al., 2009)</div> 
									<br>
								</div>


								<p>The benefits of this model are: its ability to map the factors that affect a
								customer’s brand decision and; where companies can adjust for their own gain.
								It must be identified that this model is concerned with the customer decision –
								not with company-side moves, yet they are not mutually exclusive. The process
								seemingly begins once the customer desires a certain item – which, in
								modernity, could be spurred by necessity, or encouraged by media successfully
								instilling a perceived benefit of product ownership (Huang, 2023b; Llopis, 2014).</p>

								<p>Henceforth – the brand equity model views features that alter public perception
								of brand value; whilst the customer decision journey focuses on consumer’s
								buying habits, and how such aforementioned perceptions can inform their
								purchasing decisions.</p>

								<div class="sectionNote"> 
									Note: the 7 Cs – Context, Content, Community, Customisation, Communication,
									Connection and Commerce (Oliver, no date): can be directly connected to
									success within the customer’s active evaluation stage.
								</div>
								<br>
								
								<p>Consequently, a full marketing evaluation model is discerned:</p>

								<div class="sectionFigure noEffects"> 
									<img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_7.png">  
									<div class="overlay">Figure 6: The customer decision process based on perceived brand equity</div> 
									<br>
								</div>

								<p>Of note is the marketing team’s responsibility for message encoding, via media,
								for public consumption, in case message misinterpretation harms the brand.</p>

						<h2>4.0 ANALYSIS</h2>

							<div class="sectionText">
								<p>Nike currently holds a 38% market share in the athletic clothing industry
								(Investing.com, 2023).</p>

								<div class="sectionFigure"> 
									<img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_8.png">  
									<div class="overlay">Figure 7: Financial information of the World’s largest sneaker brands (Source: statista, 2023)</div> 
									<br>
								</div>

								<p>As mentioned before, Nike’s strategy consists of excellent sports
								ambassadorship alongside well-planned sub-branding to accelerate brand
								recognition. For instance: the NFL’s super bowl, boasted 113m viewers in 2023
								(Johnson, 2023). Nike endorses (and designs) the NFL’s kits, increasing
								recognition (Liberto, 2020). Nike’s market message encoding is known for its
								simplicity and directness: Nike aims to relate every viewer to a world-renown athlete, 
								through emotional advertising (Wu, 2022). Within the brand equity
								model and during the initial decision stage: Nike has already outclassed its
								competition, placing identifiable figures at the forefront of their marketing
								campaigns, and allowing passive advertisement through viewers watching
								athletes perform (Abad-Santos, 2018; Vinlove, 2022).</p>


								<div class="sectionFigure"> 
									<img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_9.png">  
									<div class="overlay">Figure 8: Colin Kapernick’s advertising campaign for Nike (Source: Abad-Santos, 2018)</div> 
									<br>
								</div>


								<div class="sectionFigure"> 
									<img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_10.png">  
									<div class="overlay">Figure 9: Custom Nike-Jordan brand ‘cleats’ worn by an NFL player (Source: Vinlove, 2022)</div> 
									<br>
								</div>



								<p>These methods mirror automotive product-placement within cinema, and are
								seemingly as effective (Lewin, 2022). In-accordance with the consumer-led
								revolution: viewing athletes perform in Nike gear strengthens one’s brand recall,
								while building trustworthiness that translates into both functional and symbolic
								benefit (Keller, 1993). A thought can illustrate this:</p>


								<div class="sectionNote"> 
									“If Michael Jordan won Defensive Player of the Year and an NBA
									Championship in Nike-crafted footwear: I can win my college basketball
									game in Nike too.”
								</div>


								<div class="sectionFigure"> 
									<img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_0.png">  
									<div class="overlay">Figure 10: Financial information of the World’s largest sneaker brands (Source: statista, 2023)</div> 
									<br>
								</div>



								<p>Whilst a fictitious statement, it
								elucidates the perceived gain that a
								Nike product purchase could make.
								While these athlete stories attract an
								audience to Nike’s brand, they can also
								deter leisure consumers (Willigan,
								2014). It is evident, that athleisure
								clothing holds its fair share of issues
								(TechnoGym, no date). Nike is not
								excluded from this: their pursuit of a
								reasonable balance of athletic and
								apparel footwear warrants scepticism
								from extreme fashion consumers and
								elite-echelon athletes (TICMall, 2022).
								Nike does mitigate this through
								specification within sub-branding;
								however, Nike’s own popularity creates
								issues: evidenced by the Jordan sub-
								brand.</p>

								<p>Jordan’s, designed for Jordan’s on-court performance, were marketed as the
								ultimate basketball footwear, yet, their popularity has since mythologised them
								in fashion (Wilbekin, 2023). This creates difficulty designing future products,
								which must now balance comfort with performance (Levine, 2022).</p>

								<p>To exemplify this: a consumer – fictitiously named Rose – wishes to purchase
								basketball shoes for an upcoming game. While she has recalled and considered
								Jordan’s in her initial exploration, she has read reviews on an external brand’s
								in-game effectiveness and, coupled with her pre-conceived attitude of Jordan’s
								being an aesthetic line: she has removed Nike from her active evaluation
								(Wilbekin, 2023; Levine, 2022, TICMall, 2022).</p>

								<p>Nike’s brand equity is extremely dependent on secondary association. The
								adoption of ambassadors and sponsorship could be deemed risk-seeking:
								generating high profits from athletic performance yet allowing huge cash-loss
								amidst scandal. Evidencing this: the Fifa scandal of 2015 lead to a noticeable
								revenue decrease, due to Nike’s ill-placed decision to “seemingly” endorse
								corruption (Sports Business Journal, 2015; McGreal, 2015). Furthermore,
								disgraced athletes can damage Nike’s image of perseverance and athletic
								success through hard-work, such as with Lance Armstrong’s doping scandal
								(Williams, 2012). The largest threat, however, is undoubtedly the loss of loyal
								customers – who usually bypass external exploration due to their familiarity with
								the Nike product (Elzinga et al., 2009).</p>

								<p>Acknowledging Nike’s brand strategy’s pitfalls, numerous solutions exist. For the
								initial decision process, it is recommended that Nike refrains from sponsorship of
								entire sporting events. There are too many unknown factors (from Nike’s
								intelligence’s viewpoint) that could lead to reputational disaster (Sports Business
								Journal, 2015). Additionally, Nike should aim to further promote proven,
								trustworthy, dependable athletes that have displayed engaging stories and
								excellent resilience in their careers.</p>

								<p>In coherence, Nike should either separate their product lines further, or provide
								analysis on product performance for athletic events.</p>

									<br>
								</div>


								<div class="sectionNote"> 
									An aside: Nike’s choice of name and logo
									deliberately manipulate brand awareness
									(Keller, 1993). Nike, named for the Greek
									goddess of victory, is both unique and
									semantically symbolic of their mission
									(Nike.com, no date). The name’s uniqueness
									makes it recognisable amongst product
									assortments, whilst the swoosh logo is iconic
									and easy to instantly recall. This swoosh
									deliberately adorns Nike’s product packaging, a
									brand attribute that is expertly leveraged for
									benefit (Keller, 1993). Both contribute to an
									exceptional global brand awareness.
									</div>

									<p>Assuming positive brand equity, during the active evaluation phase, Nike’s e-
									commerce platform applies the 7-Cs effectively to gain a competitive edge
									(Huang, 2023a; Oliver, no date).</p>

									<p>Nike’s website eloquently integrates both aesthetic design and ergonomics
									(Nielsen, 1994). The search and purchase processes are simplistic and
									accessible; the site avoids latency and; the structure is well-distributed with its
									emphasis on products (Nike.com, no date). Additionally, Nike’s content holds
									both breadth and depth, boasting a wide product range with many
									personalisation options. (Tighe, 2022).</p>

									<div class="sectionFigure"> 
										<img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_14.pdf">  
										<div class="overlay">Figure 13: Nike’s revenue form the broad product range (Source: Statista, 2022)</div>

									<div class="sectionFigure"> 
										<img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_15.png">  
										<div class="overlay">Figure 14: Nike’s e-commerce platform (Source: Nike.com, no date)</div> 
									</div>


									<p>Nike ensures accessible customer communication, yet their customer decision
									journey is afflicted by a lack of social network for Nike products. It is notoriously
									known that most sale of premium Nike products occurs outside of Nike’s jurisdiction, 
									highlighting an area of opportunity by allowing the auctioning and
									direct peer-to-peer sale of product (StockX, no date).</p>


									<div class="sectionFigure"> 
										<img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_16.png">  
										<div class="overlay">Figure 15: StockX’s e-commerce platform (Source: StockX, no date)</div> 
									</div>

									<p>Despite this, Nike’s e-commerce platform aids in the facilitation of progression
									towards customer purchase.</p>

									<p>While allowing for positive consumer experience and an increased likelihood of
									purchase, Nike’s leisure options seem less adequate than other brands. Adidas
									exemplifies a differing secondary association than Nike’s; utilising artists and
									musicians to produce distinct shoe-lines, as opposed to athletes. A
									recommendation is thus to recruit those within the entertainment sector, to
									produce new Nike lines, in addition to the already established athlete-base.</p>

									<div class="sectionFigure"> 
										<img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_17.png">  
										<div class="overlay">Figure 16: An assortment of Pharrell William’s Adidas collaboration: Supercolour Superstars</div>

										<img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_18.png">  
										<div class="overlay">Figure 17: Pharrell Williams (Source: thecut.com, 2023)</div> 
									</div>

									<p>To improve across both the customer decision journey and Nike’s brand model,
									emphasis must be placed on new, neglected user journeys. Nike could invest in
									those far removed from sport: providing purely leisure footwear
									or, dedicate themselves entirely to athletic-wear (Willigan, 2014). In
									conjunction, Nike should aim to increase ambassadorship outside of the
									“western world”: a number of unique sports are played on the Indian sub-
									continent, for instance, which offers a large enough population to impact
									revenue (Farooqui, 2022). To illustrate this, an advertisement campaign within
									the sport of Kabaddi could hold huge benefit for Nike and their brand (Farooqui,
									2022). Similarly, Nike, understandably, currently holds no presence in the
									corporate-world; an area for expansion if marketed correctly (Sidhu, 2014).</p>

						<h2>5.0 CONCLUSION</h2>

							<div class="sectionText">
								<p>Nike’s brand is instantaneously recognisable. This is through the strategic
								leveraging of athletes to enforce brand exposure. While this is highly effective
								within Nike’s sphere of influence; there are numerous avenues to better brand
								development, even in lieu of their global dominance. Nike’s largest issue is a
								semantic one: the encoding of Nike’s media has diffused a clear interpretation of
								the Nike shoe: is it solely for leisure or solely for competition?
								Furthermore, Nike has an opportunity to branch into new markets, and should
								look to capitalise on sports more obscure to the western world.</p>
