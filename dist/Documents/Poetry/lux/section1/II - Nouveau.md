# II - Nouveau
From brimstone yields shards of stardust aged yonder,
The crack of air scares every dove every-time.

The slab slaps the cradled,
Turns blue to harsh red, 
Tries scaring the steel worse than future's faint hums.

How precious the stone be,
Forgotten at large,
Now the specks of said stardust have left its embrace.

Soon speckled and phoney,
How the sleet doth slay far,
Could relate this to sand-child: glass panes in your hearth.

From where did one's mirror, one's prism arrive?

Forgotten, its presence has turned all such eyes.

The holy, the felled, the demon alike.

See potent lil' panes of translucence: arise.
