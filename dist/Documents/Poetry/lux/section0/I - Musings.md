# I - Musings
Nothing has form, violence and vitriol,
Nothing has shape, a void of mass caves,
Nothing was born from mere children of chaste,
Nothing sprung forth from gods and myth-makes.

*This nothing you speak of*,
*Has nothing innate*,
*How could it hold weight, 
or value to take,
This 'byss you speak of*,
*Holds no such slight shape*,
*'Tis empty, nothing - for nothing's sake*

This silence holds weight, do believe it so,
The echoes of solace do hurt idled folk,
The mired mage did profess its growth,
Soon bear witness, from nothing, something grows,

*I believe these lies, not*,
*I hold no such witch-worship*,
*I believe in what's seen, what I hear bears unnerving*,

Then those eyes shall deceive,
For their value is curtained,
The mirror of learned life, is soon to be turgid.
