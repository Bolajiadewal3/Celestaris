# III- Ex Nihilo
But a spark, a tinder-tint of flame-flared virulence,
Leapt from the frame of impossible tessellation-
-And scarred the world anew.

*From where did this spark arise?
By whomst does it identify.*

Have you not listened?
From nothing comes more, from more, some and from some, form.

*More witch-wisdom and riddles,
I grow tired of you, bard.*

Grow tired of the world then.
For this truth is inalienable.
From silence, cinder,
From pause, pleasure,
From Vanta, vacuous raptures of applause against serenity.
Let us salute this birth asunder.
