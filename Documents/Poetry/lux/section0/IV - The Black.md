# IV - The Black
We meet to muse again, young mare of mine,
Let us ramble on the splendour of its arrival.
As before bade, the black yielded blue, the dark graced by starlight.
The night scurried in the presence of divine contradictions.

*I tire from your ramblings,
I demand true answers,
For what reason must I lay and await your sick-sermons.
Every cell lies, every falsehood feigned: as if you yourself believe your errors true?*

This impetuous desire, 
This twisted rage,
Turn those pulses beyond reason and reason you'll make,
This chasing of ire, 
This paradise wanes,
Place faith in faith's features and be blessed by the pain,
Of futile pursuits,
That hold weight in malfeasance,
Those pleasures past paid now yield sorrows untamed,
Yet from darkness bore fruit,
The black did yield heathens,
From the void came a prism, un-moulded, un-phased.
