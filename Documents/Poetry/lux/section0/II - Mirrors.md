# II - Mirrors
If it looked through that slab, pained to reflect visage,
Would it see itself, for itself is nothing?

*By no means*,
*How could the formless see form, or yet take it for foreign witness?*

An inquisition of great altitude, yet failed in its workings,
Itself would be seen, for its sight is mere nothing.

*No more fables and myths, relayed truths of fact-fiction,
Yield your sermons on silence while serenity is salacious.*

By no means will these pleas relent musing in surplus,
The pane of sand-child does perceive the unknown.
