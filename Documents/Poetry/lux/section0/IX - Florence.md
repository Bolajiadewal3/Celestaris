# IX - Florence
Night, entails choirs of silent, dull phases,
In gales of sly winds one hears gusts of pains paid,
As price for one's pleasures, vices and tastes:
Bear witness to burdens, Sisyphean, sacred.

While such misery occurs, domains do open,
While deities lay eyes on the sufferings they covet.
The black births blue, the blue births more:
Darkened depths, once whole do salute fresh new puppets.

Dereliction amongst them, the darkened, one means.
The rays that did hit, left deep scars since unseen,
Now none the wiser, new newts on the scene:
No guides, no preachers; just lenses, now: clean.
