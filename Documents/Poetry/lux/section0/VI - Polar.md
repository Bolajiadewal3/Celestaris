# VI - Polar
*I refute your claims,
They hold no value to me,
Continue your myriad of mental miseries on your own,
For no one is listening.*

So be it, this reflection shall take silent form,
Mere thoughts given life through the eyes of some seer,
To whom peers through the pixels, and perceives these paints- 
-mental mixtures: magenta, mercury, sage.

A pane hit by rays of unseen sorrow, akin to one hit by the sun's own screams,
Relate then this slab slapped by time once borrowed, to shots from a bow from Apollo himself,
Let the mind merge the morrow, and ponder these postulates,
Let the words of this miser, once wiser, prevail,
If the surface goes deeper, metaphysical, unreal,
Replace light, with life: rays of white, rays of time.
