# IV - Unholy
Who bade you speak in the presence of holies,
Untouched sand-children of whom darkness made.

Who bade you think in the presence of foli's,
This folio fixed with the fleeting of fame.

Who bade you to see this reclined divination,
Deity's works now abandoned by unholy saints.

Untempered, slabbed solely for imprints on babes,
These prisms arise independent of praise.

For this penchant for prose does proceed one's ponies,
Impossible realms made real by whom wrote.

This treatise holds soul fees,
This painting, holds haste,
Larger lesson on how one's own lens did first float.
