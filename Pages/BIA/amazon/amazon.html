                                <h3>Amazon’s Business Model</h3>

								<p>Jeff Bezos’ Amazon is built on a number of simple principles, including (Amazon.com, no date):</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Aiming to be Earth’s most customer-centric company</li>
                                    <li>Aiming to obsess over customers</li>
                                    <li>Recognising that some decisions are consequential and irreversible […], But most decisions aren’t like that</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>The flywheel designed by Bezos encapsulates this (Amazon.com, no date):</p>

								</div>


                                <p>An evaluation of Amazon’s e-commerce strategy reveals Amazon.com’s target areas (Slater, no date): Providing customer value 
                                    through lower prices; huge selection range and; customer convenience: striving to better the diffusion of innovation curve, 
                                    evidenced by Bezos himself (Rogers, 1983; Amazon.com, no date):</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
                                        We want to be a large company that’s also an invention machine

                                    </li>

                                        <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
                                        Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline… And that is why it is
                                         always Day 1
                                         <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
                                        </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Amazon aims to increase the number of innovators and early adopters while decreasing the laggards. Thus frontier technology is pushed,
                                     changing their e-commerce presentation. To achieve this, their e-commerce platform encourages a two-way network of buying and selling
                                      between parties; facilitated by in-house technologies (Jewell, 2017; TipRanks, 2023; SimilarWeb, 2023; Semrush, 2023):
                                </p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Cloud53: Their custom configurable DNS</li>
                                    <li>CloudFront: which reduces latency through data-packet route specification</li>
                                    <li>AWS WAF: offering pingback attack protection via filtering</li>
                                    <li>AWS Shield: which Protects HTTP layers 3-7 against DDoS attacks</li>
                                    <li>DynamoDB: Their non-relational database to handle the 2.5 – 3B visits/month to Amazon.com</li>
                                </ul>


                               <p>Amazon’s distribution is aimed at continuous improvement, via innovation; while their financial strategy stems from fast cash flow, 
                                aided by partnerships and brand deals, benefitting Amazon in the long-term.</p>

                                <p>Amazon.com’s website is predicated on both SQL and NoSQL databases, having successfully migrated from Oracle-leased databases to their own:
                                    Aurora, and DynamoDB; reducing annual expenditure (Bar, 2019; TelcoDR, 2022). This accounts for the fast speed of Amazon’s search engine and information display
                                     – increasing usability (Deloitte, no date; Ruihan & Zong-Mou, 2017). </p>

                                <p>Furthermore, a feature that is not covered in later heuristic inspections (discernable via pluralistic walkthrough or feature inspection) is Amazon.com’s use of 
                                    Artificial Intelligence to recommend products (Nielsen, 1994; Virinchi, 2022; Hardesty, 2022). Products are recommended based on previous searches, recording 
                                    user activity during sessions.</p>

                                     A user story can illustrate this. User A – Alex is a young football player who wishes to purchase playing boots:</p>

                                    </div>

								<p>Alex wishes to search, and Amazon.com accommodates this with a function at the screen’s summit, coupled with a label:
                                     Search Amazon, and looking-glass icon, synonymous with computer search (Sherwin, 2014).
                                     Additionally, one can specify the search department: increasing search speed and narrowing options (Inci, 2020).</p>

								<p>n conjunction, user input is not limited to words, allowing criterion selection,
                                     or screen manipulation to select categories from the landing. The output is near instantaneous,
                                      producing a formatted set of results. </p>

	



                        <h3>Alex’s User Journey</h3>


                        <div class="sectionFigure"> 
                            <img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_3_3.png">  
                            <div class="overlay"> Figure 7: The product search result screen – as seen by Alex</div> 
                        </div>


                        <p>Alex’s perspective on usability is guided by numerous stylistic decisions. The aforementioned landing page emphasizes search, 
                            while the product page aims to entice Alex to select certain product choices, for Amazon’s benefit (Nielsen, 1999). 
                            The subtle use of colour to draw attention towards product promotion evidences this: 
                            with save 5% and Amazon’s Choice attracting the user’s gaze via colour contrast (Beaird, 2008). </p>

                        <p>The display is efficient, with a tabularised, reusable layout for each item, and a design that meets customer expectations to display:
                             brand, name and price; although size is omitted (for clothing)  – possibly deliberately: 
                             if users knew their item was unavailable, it would reduce the chance of entertaining alternatives (Cilliers & Meyer, 2023; Davis, 2019).</p>
                        
                        <p>Amazon’s customer focus informs their use of product images as focal points on the page, with the price being of secondary concern to 
                            entice buyers to select products that match their aesthetic. Between two pages, the three essential requirements for a good e-commerce
                             site are met, yet their minutiae warrants discussion. </p>
                        
                        <p>The product page (assuming boot selection) is tripartite, with the product’s information emphasised through having the largest, 
                            centrally-positioned section (Beaird, 2008). This information is split horizontally with the most valuable information taking 
                            precedence: name 
                            <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-right"></i>
                            price 
                            <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-right"></i>
                            colour 
                            <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-right"></i>
                            size, then additional information. This embraces the concept of continual flow of sight; 
                            guiding the user to view the most important information first and proceed naturally down towards information that less concerning 
                            to Amazon itself (Lupton, 2008).</p>
                        
                        <p>Breaking this slightly, the price is placed in a position that is roughly central, in an emboldened font style, 
                            attracting attention to Amazon’s flywheel philosophy of lower pricing, 
                            which instigates positive customer experience (Amazon.com, no date).</p>

                            <div class="sectionFigure"> 
                                <img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_3_3.png">  
                                <div class="overlay">Figure 8: The product pre-purchase screen – as seen by Alex</div> 
                            </div>




                            <p>Differing from this, emphasis via isolation is present with the purchasing menu,
                                 which is separated by a border from the rest of the screen, to entice purchase (Beaird, 2008). 
                                 This is furthered by the use of yellow and orange which stand out distinctly from the white and darker blue hues of the page,
                                  both imploring the user to make a decision towards purchasing the product.</p>

                            <p>The subtle use of colour theory is prevalent on this screen, with the aforementioned yellow and orange hues contrasting the blues 
                                of the rest of the page (Beaird, 2008). While not specifically complementary, the orange hue’s complements are more luminous and 
                                saturated shades of the blues used along the navigation section (the same cannot be said for the yellow) (Canva.com, no date; 
                                Color-calculator.com, 2021):</p>

                            <p>In concluding Alex’s pre-purchase journey, all three pages minimally showcase system status via the search bar, 
                                adding a grey overly to the rest of the screen, yet none showcase the status concerning active screen sections (on mouse hover) 
                                barring the product page’s gallery (Harley, 2018). This could be improved, changing the hue of the white space in hovered areas 
                                subtly to accommodate the customer-centric model Amazon prides itself upon. In addition, a subtle-timed colour change effect on 
                                the purchase buttons would immediately attract attention from users,  which would entice purchase (Prisacari & Holme, 2013).</p>


                                <div class="sectionFigure"> 
                                    <img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_3_3.png">

                            <p>Improvements have been seen in the past, with the lack of a site-wizard stemming from the same reasoning behind the removal of 
                                the tab feature that Amazon held for the entire early 2000s: over-clustering of information via proximity made the site more
                                 difficult to navigate; especially while early adopters were its primary users (Beaird, 2008; Wroblewski, 2005; Nielsen, 2005;
                                  Rogers, 1983).</p>

								<p>In order to effectively evaluate Amazon.com in more depth, simple heuristic evaluations can be deployed. 
                                    For this, two new user scenarios will be introduced. User B – Ben and User C – Christina, holding differing goals:</p>

                                    <h3>Evaluations</h3>


								<p>Three different heuristics have been employed to ensure a variety of design areas are scrutinised.
                                     The first inspects a set of achievable rules (Shneiderman et al., 2018):</p>

                                     <div class="sectionFigure"> 
                                        <img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_3_3.png">  
                                        <div class="overlay">Figure 12: Heuristic evaluation utilising Schneiderman’s eight golden rules of user interface design</div> 
                                    </div>

								<p>Amazon.com is excellent at reducing the need for information recall, 
                                    with their simple UI allowing the user to simply browse products as-if they were window-shopping in real-life,
                                    while the speed of load of the page additionally contributes to a sense of easy-use, 
                                    and reduces the likelihood of site abandonment (Tuch et al., 2012; Deloitte, no date; Lindgaard et al., 2006).
                                     As well as this, the storefront has a consistent layout and use of a simple colour palette (Color-Picker.com, 2022; 
                                     Colordesigner.io, no date). </p>


                                      <div class="sectionFigure"> 
                                        <img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_3_3.png">

                                    </div>



                                    <p>It is clear from this subjective evaluation that the main issues stemming from Amazon.com are its lack of user
                                         feedback and user action strictness. Amazon.com could take inspiration from Asos.com: which utilises three methods
                                          of feedback: Upon hovering over a product, a different angle is displayed, showcasing mouse position; within the
                                           navigation system, active sections produce sub-menus via an overlay on the screen and; when searching for a product,
                                            filters are highlighted blue when hovered over, to ensure the user is aware of their current location (ASOS.com, no date).</p>

                                    <p>The second heuristic (page below) interrogates Amazon.com based on its user experience (Tognazzini, 2014).
                                         Through this, an instance of achieved accessibility is discerned, as the site does seem to accommodate 
                                         for the colour-blind population –  comprising 1 in 12 men according to the NEI (Venngage.com, no date; 
                                         National Eye Institute, 2019).</p>
                                    
                                    <div class="sectionFigure">

                                    <p>The above heuristic is rigorous in exposing areas for improvement. Again: autonomy, colour and consistency are implemented successfully,
                                         alongside readability and learnability; however, Christina was limited in options if a payment mistake occurred, while critical
                                          functions were not always visible to both users.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The latter issue poses a larger problem - as international users and people that tend to scroll on webpages would both struggle 
                                        with Amazon: the visible currency change option is located in the footer and; the navigation system does not follow the user down 
                                        the page. These are simple to change: display the currency more obviously in navigation to ensure correct utilisation, 
                                        and force the navigation bar scroll.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Apple.com utilises this sticky navigation bar to great effect (Anthony, 2022; Apple.com, no date):</p>
                                    


                                    <div class="sectionFigure"> 
                                        <img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_3_3.png">

                                    <p>A subtle feature that Amazon utilises, is the application of Fitt’s law (Budiu, 2022). The icons and selected objects on Amazon’s site are easy to hover over and hard to misclick, which demonstrates a good application of the within UI/UX.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>While the usability of Amazon.com is clearly the driving force behind its design, the lack of obvious ratios in page sectioning is apparent, and its inclusion could benefit user experience. The golden ratio evokes a positive response from users when utilised to distribute webpage sections and could be employed on the search results screen (Beaird, 2008). Additionally, the filter section (which in theory, would now occupy near to a third of the screen’s width) could benefit from the addition of icons, to better partition the clustered text that may prove difficult for some to read (Nair, 2021). </p>
                                    
                                    <div class="sectionFigure"> 
                                        <img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_3_3.png">

                                    <p>The difficulty imposed by the filter section shows a lack of accoutance for accessibility within Amazon’s design (CDC.com, 2018). Without signing in – one cannot access the accessibility menu, and this creates a paradox: accessibility cannot be accessed without logging in, which may be impossible for a particular user without changing said settings. Take, for instance, User D – Demetri, who has poor eyesight and utilises text-to-speech. In the absence of a text-to-speech function, Demetri is left unable to locate the login window and thus unable to progress through the website. </p>

                                    <p>This predicament requires one of two possible solutions: enforcing a login upon entry, or ensuring that accessibility settings are clear,
                                         obvious and changeable from the landing page of the website (Pinedo, 2020).</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The flaws in Amazon.com’s site revealed by the previous heuristics are exacerbated by the third, which elucidates the same issues (Nielsen, 1994):</p>
                                    
                                    <div class="sectionFigure">

							<div class="sectionText">

								<p>Utilising elements of the usability heuristics mentioned above, a new model could be proposed for Amazon.com:</p>

                                <div class="sectionFigure">

                                <p>Note the ease of use one has in accessing: location, language and currency if a search requires a change. Additionally, the colour scheme has been selected with brighter blue hues that are more harmonious with the vibrant yellows/oranges. </p>

                                <p>The Golden ratio has been applied to the split of the screens contents, to avoid an over-clustering of products, and this informs the list structure as well.</p>

						<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

							<div class="sectionText">

                                <p>In summation, Amazon.com excels in the design of its website for its purpose – to entice the customer to conduct fast-paced purchase of products, 
                                and offer alternatives should they not find their desired product. However, Amazon.com has a number of limitations, namely:
                                 their lack of easy accessibility settings access; their lack of error diagnostics for the user’s benefit and; 
                                 an overall lack of state feedback to allow the user to understand their position on the page.</p>

                                <p>These drawbacks do not damage Amazon’s reputation or business performance, but may hold a monetary cost as it increases
                                     the amount of time it takes for customers to make their transactions and could potentially deter impatient customers 
                                     altogether (Brutlag, 2009).</p>
