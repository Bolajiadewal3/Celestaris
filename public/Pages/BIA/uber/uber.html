	<p>
        Uber’s business vision is to (Sawhney et al., 2019):
    </p>
    <p>
		<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
        <em>
            Build an <strong>effortless</strong> pickup experience for
            <strong>
                everyone, everywhere, everytime
            </strong>
        </em>
		<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
    </p>

	<p>
        Based on this vision the most important features are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            ETA vs ATA
        </li>
        <li>
            Driver loops around rendezvous
        </li>
        <li>
            Rider/driver contact rate
        </li>
        <li>
            Number of steps walked by riders
        </li>
    </ul>

	<p>
        The weighting shifts primarily towards passive signals, as these are
        guaranteed to be discrete values – active ones may require
        interpretation and translation (Qualaroo, 2023). In addition, human
        error or lack of effort could diminish active signal quality (Cloke,
        2023).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some features are subtly conveyed via the selected ones through
        reasoning, for instance:
    </p>
    <p>
        ETA vs ATA being high implies either a PLE occurred or; a support ticket
        was filed
    </p>
    <p>
        In another example: the number of steps walked being high could reveal a
        PLE.
    </p>

	<h3> 1.2 Metric</h3>

	<p>
        Pickup quality = minimise (30% * ETA vs ATA)
    </p>
    <p>
        + minimise (20% * Driver loops around rendezvous)
    </p>
    <p>
        + minimise (25% * number of steps walked by riders)
    </p>
    <p>
        + <strong>maximise</strong> (15% rider/driver contact rate)
    </p>
    <p>
        + minimise (10% * sum(all third-party signals))
    </p>



	<p>
        This selection can be corroborated utilising the journey-level pain
        points from the case study (Gibbons, 2021; Sawhney et al., 2019):
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>contextualise</em> pain point reveals that a low-confidence
        location resulted in 50 steps being walked by a rider with foot pain. If
        all else was positive, then reduction of this feature - via a better
        location-confidence; would result in a far better experience.
    </p>

	</div>

	<p>
        Likewise, the <em>depict</em> scenario showcases a good pickup
        experience. However, to elevate it: maximising the rider/driver contact
        would have facilitated communication of the exact rider location.

        The metric should accurately represent Uber’s <em>north star metric</em>
        : the number of successful rides completed per day (Ellis, 2017).

    <p>
        It should be noted that if the feature range was not restricted,
        numerous could be added:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Congested routes taken could be minimised
        </li>
        <li>

        <li>
            Driver to rider score-matching could be employed
        </li>
        <li>
            Use of voice-commands should be recorded – hotspots could see a
            surge in usage
        </li>
        <li>
            Phone service providers could be partnered with to improve
            low-confidence locations when GPS is weaker
        </li>

								<p>
									For clarity of argument, it is inferred that operator describes any user
									that engages with the active uber experience.

								<h3>2.2 Increasing Time Estimation Accuracy</h3>


								<p>
									Uber’s estimated arrival-times are generated utilising predictive
									analytics, with accepted error margins (Hu et al., 2022a). Uber utilises
									terrain maps and the Global Navigation Satellite System [GNSS ] (Iland,
									2018). Certain functions are employed to minimise prediction errors
									(i.e. <em>shadow mapping</em> allows for accuracy in low-confidence
									areas). While this is beneficial; the model currently requires downtime
									to test, limiting real-time accuracy (Hu et al., 2022b). A method should
									allow for <em>continuous, incremental</em>training instead (Hu et al.,
									2022b).
								</p>


								<div class="sectionFigure"> 
		<img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_3.png">  
		<div class="overlay">Figure 5: Alex’s User Story</div> 
	</div>


								<h3>2.3 Reducing chance of driver loops</h3>

								<p>
									Drivers looping could be reduced by increased rider/driver contact time,
									and extreme options:
								</p>

								<p>
									If a driver takes too long to arrive at their destination, and has been
									static for a while, a notification could allow them to re-offer the job
									to nearby ubers. The driver could receive a percentage compensation, or
									still complete the job if they begin to move again – however it a car
									that is on a less congested route could complete the job in a more
									timely fashion: keeping uber customer-centric.

								</div>

								<p>
									In addition, a slight delay to movement animation on the rider side
									application is recommended. The map view is prone to car icon jumps in areas
									when <em>shadow mapping</em> is applied – instead of just GNSS (Shekhar
									&amp; Sankaravadivel, 2019). Adding a subtle delay would gift more time to
									allow location smoothing (Shekhar &amp; Sankaravadivel, 2019).
								</p>

								


								<h3>2.4 Increasing the rider/contract time</h3>

								<p>
									To increase contact time between operators: drivers must either text or call
									riders upon arrival <strong>at</strong> <strong>least</strong> once. If not,
									it could negatively affect their score. Additionally, a notification should
									tell the rider to message their driver, not just meet them.
								</p>

									<img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_3.png">  
									<div class="overlay">Figure 5: Alex’s User Story</div> 
								</div>

								<h3>2.5 Decreasing steps walked by riders</h3>
								<p>
									Currently, map-matching calculates accurate spots for drivers (Shekhar &amp;
									Sankaravadivel, 2019). Other methods are more accurate but computationally
									intense (Shekhar &amp; Sankaravadivel, 2019). An example is
									<em>
										dead reckoning
									</em>
									which allows for smoothing between poor GPS points utilising mathematical
									equations (Shekhar &amp; Sankaravadivel, 2019). To conglomerate these
									results: Beacon conveys information to differing phones by deciding on
									formulae in accordance with the device in use (Shekhar &amp; Sankaravadivel,
									2019).
								</p>
								<p>
									Some devices do not convey certain parameters for shadow matching – as they
									have rules governing information sharing. For instance, iPhones do not
									automatically send information, thus other, costly methods must be expended
									[i.e. Bluetooth connections] (Shekhar &amp; Sankaravadivel, 2019).
								</p>
								<p>
									iPhones thus need to be better leveraged technologically to extract their
									GPS information, to allow for more time to correct errors and display
									information to the user.

                                <h3>3.1	The business problem</h3>


								<p>
									How does one provide
									<em>
										an effortless pickup experience for everyone, everywhere, everytime
									</em>
								</p>
								<p>
									The basic need offered by Uber is effortless transit (Cooper, 2014; Sawhney
									et al., 2019): This benefits the customer as well as the riders - who gain
									an income avenue; while external stakeholders gain profits.
								</p>
								<p>
									The desired objective is provision of the perfect pickup (MBEC, 2022;
									Sawhney et al., 2019). Steps towards combatting the business problem have
									already been initiated, with a 2016 paradigm-shift towards destination-first
									customer autonomy (Sawhney et al., 2019). In addition, two ML platforms have
									been employed before: <em>Horovod</em> and <em>Michelangelo</em> – but are
									open to improvement (Shao &amp; Islam, 2021a). Uber actively embraces
									Artificial Intelligence, so the goals of this solution are in alignment with
									the company’s philosophy. In conjunction, the benefits of such decision
									support will be monetary in value. (Dean, 2014):
								</p>
								
								<div class="sectionFigure"> 
									<img src="/files/bia/nike/Nike_3.png">  
									<div class="overlay">Figure 5: Alex’s User Story</div> 
								</div>

								<p>
									Uber’s true problem is the need to enhance methods for relationship
									management between stakeholders. The principle of choice henceforth is a
									model that can provide said enhancement  consistently (Turban et al., 2015).
									In solving the surface and deep-level business problems; Uber could adopt
									the Agile methodology for <em>continuous improvement</em> upon the ML model
									that is to be described (Project Management Institute, 2017; Harirajan,
									2022).
								</p>
							


								<h3>3.2 Viability of Machine Learning</h3>

								<p>
									Machine learning, which has already been employed, is only of use - in this
									scenario - to Uber if other methods of prediction fail (Dean, 2014). Simple
									mathematical equations are not suitable for the number of factors that Uber
									stores. This data is largely unstructured, stored in a format that is
									difficult in understanding for humans,  crafting a perfect opportunity for
									ML to be employed (Lee &amp; Obermeyer, 2017).
								</p>
								<p>
									Currently, Uber utilises a metric to model the quality of their data storage
									– CAP (Zhong &amp; Cheng, 2021):
								</p>
								<p>
									Cost-Efficiency X Accuracy X Performance = Constant
								</p>
								<p>
									The underperformer in the model currently is performance, with the cost of
									collecting data being minimised already by a number of size reduction
									techniques such as– data storage on
									<em>
										the Apache® Hadoop® File System (HDFS) space
									</em>
									, in <em>Apache Hive <sup>TM</sup> tables</em> (Shao &amp; Islam 2021b).
								</p>
								<p>
									Machine learning is necessary due to the sheer amount of data that Uber
									receives. It has 134,000 HDDs allocated to information storage, with the
									average size being 4TB (Shao &amp; Islam, 2021c).
								</p>
								<p>
									ML is therefore a viable option: there is a well-defined problem to be
									solved by such algorithms; there is an abundance of continuously updated
									data; said data is relevant to the problem and cleanable; the results of
									data analysis would directly impact the problem and; it is clear that the
									volume of data prevents problem solution through traditional means (Dean,
									2014).
								</p>
								<p>
									A structured decision problem can thus be presented:
								</p>
								<p>
									How can profit be maximised, when profit directly correlates to pickup
									quality
								</p>
								<p>
									&amp;
								</p>
								<p>
									Pickup quality = minimise (30% * ETA vs ATA)
								</p>
								<p>
									+ minimise (20% * Driver loops around rendezvous)
								</p>
								<p>
									+ minimise (25% * number of steps walked by riders)
								</p>
								<p>
									+ maximise (15% rider/driver contact rate)
								</p>
								<p>
									+ minimise (10% * sum(all third-party signals))
								</p>
								<p>
									It must be acknowledged, that the use of passive signals is to mitigate the
									subjectivity of some active signals .
								</p>
		




								<h3>3.3 Data Gathering</h3>



								<p>
									Uber’s data storage initially utilised only Online transaction processing
									databases [OLTP] to handle their data requirement (Reza, 2018). This
									provided fast latency for TBs of data. In 2016, this was replaced with a
									data-warehouse. Difficulty in its use stemmed from a lack of rule
									enforcement on JSON entries from data sources (Reza, 2018).
								</p>
								<p>
									Following this, Hadoop adoption facilitated data-lake creation: to store
									standardised Parquet data (Reza, 2018). Since, Hudi has been added to
									abstract and allow querying based on time metrics (Reza, 2018). This
									data-lake is a colossal information store, combining features of both
									operational databases and data-warehouses via a Kimball approach (Reza,
									2018; Sharma, 2023a; Govindarajan, 2023):

								<p>
									Hudi stores data in adherence with the ACID transaction methodology to
									ensure data integrity (Agarwal, 2020; IBM, 2023). Schemaless then stores
									Uber trip data (Thomsen, 2016). Of note, is the lack of emphasis on the
									transformation portion of the ETL framework –preferring raw data to
									manipulate (Reza, 2018).

								<p>
									*In another filesystem these would be stored as smallInt or byte – to reduce
									memory – but Hudi’s specification allocates these to int
								</p>







								<p>
									The data collected for the quality metric offsets any trade-offs that may
									exist due to its direct applicability to the business problem.
								</p>
								<p>
									In conjunction, the inclusion of personal input is limited, due to the risk
									of bias affect predictions (Matthews, 2018).
								</p>
								<p>
									Finally, Uber could utilise additional sources going forward in their model.
									Amount earned and amount spent by drivers and riders, respectively, could
									hold an effect on their willingness to accept and search for jobs,
									respectively.
								</p>
						





								<h3>3.4 Data Pre-processing</h3>


								<p>
									Both CRISP-DM and SEMMA are viable methods for modelling Uber’s real-time
									data (Turban et al., 2015). However, CRISP-DM holds an assumption that the
									business understanding of the model is not yet identified (Turban et al.,
									2015). Thus, SEMMA will be utilised.
								</p>
								<p>
									Data sanitation is paramount to the success of the ML model. Schemaless can
									extract information on trips a sample size can be taken (Thomsen, 2016). The
									queries present information in formats that are acceptable, thus the biggest
									challenge is the data sanitation (Hermann, 2017). Data must be inspected and
									incomplete values must be rectified before training occurs (Sharma, 2023a;
									Turban et al., 2015).
								</p>
								<p>
									Artificial sampling of missing values is not viable as the possible feature
									values are impossible to predict (Sharma, 2023b; Acaps, 2016). For instance,
									the number of times a driver looped around a rendezvous cannot be merely
									chosen from a selection (Iland et al., 2018).
								</p>
								<p>
									Instead, the arithmetic mean of a feature will be selected to fill in
									missing values (Sharma, 2023b; Acaps, 2016). For example, to predict a
									driver’s ETA for their 11 <sup>th</sup> job, the previous 10 jobs ETAs to
									ATA times could be scrutinised.
								</p>
								<p>
									Outlier detection to prevent severe skew can be performed utilising the
									inter-quartile method (Sharma, 2023b; Yang, 2019). While the standard
									deviate method could apply to some features, it is safer to assume the
									central limit theorem due to the size of the dataset (LaMorte, 2016; Yang,
									2019).
								</p>
								<p>
									Uber employs offline and online data in Michelangelo (Hermann, 2017). The
									data is fed into the model through a sub-set of the Scala programming
									language (Hermann, 2017). Uber additionally utilises principal component
									analysis to find outliers in data– before it arrives at the ML model (Li et
									al., 2020).
								</p>
								<p>
									A linear programming model could be formulated to better express the
									objective of the ML model:
								</p>
								<p>
									maximise = 0.15R – 0.3T – 0.25S - 0.2L – 0.1P
								</p>
								<p>
									This would apply if the selected metric was the same as earlier.  A wider
									viewpoint on the same problem is: the ML should identify features that
									contribute to an increase in the number of high-quality rides completed per
									time period (Sawhney, 2019).
								</p>




	
								<h3>3.5 Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>

								<p>
									The crux of the business problem relies on factors that impact high-quality
									completed rides per unit time. With this single regression or classification
									(by setting a threshold) algorithms would be suitable (Chikohora, 2014).
								</p>
								<p>
									A relationship must be discerned between the features and the pickup
									experience. This warrants a linear regression model, but this may not be
									effective enough due to the size of the dataset (Chikohora, 2014). As well
									as this, the least squared error may prove a lack of strong correlation
									(Sharma, 2023c). Thus, supervised learning model must assist.
								</p>
								<p>
									To be specific: supervised decision trees could discern which features have
									the strongest impact on the classification of an experience by an operator
									(Sharma, 2023c). It could then be revealed that a number of factors have a
									larger impact than assumed.
								</p>
								<p>
									In addition, unsupervised learning can be employed. Apriori would not
									accurately represent the nature of the uber experience (Sharma, 2023d;
									Xiong, 2005). Most its conclusions would be on causally paired values
									(Sharma, 2023d; Xiong, 2005). Market basket analysis may identify a strong
									correlation between cancellation rate and rider/driver contact rate in the
									United States; however the cancellation rate could be <strong>due</strong>
									to the low contact rate – as opposed to coinciding with it.
								</p>
								<p>
									In order to model such scenarios – unsupervised neural networks could be
									trained (Sharma, 2023e). They could be utilised to independently verify the
									results generated by the decision trees (Sharma, 2023e).
								</p>
								<p>
									If such data is unavailable, then the network could be used to determine
									whether or not a certain threshold of completed jobs per unit time occurs,
									conveying a positive pickup experience (Sharma, 2023e).
								</p>
								<p>
									Note: numerical values could be normalised in the neural network to save
									computational time and improve accuracy (Sharma, 2023e; Stöttner, 2019).
								</p>
								



								<h3>3.6 Features &amp; Model improvement</h3>


								<p>
									To map the strength of the various features to Uber’s success, the linear
									regression model could once again be utilised. If the predicted variable is
									that of average trips completed per unit time <strong>or</strong>number of
									<strong>great</strong>pieces of user feedback: after receiving an output,
									the regression coefficients of the various predictor variables could be
									plotted to instantly view which has the highest impact (Sharma, 2023c).
								</p>
								<p>
									With this information, it would be easier to craft a quality metric, as the
									features that have the largest impact would be selected and their regression
									coefficients would their impact on pickup quality (Sharma, 2023c).
								</p>
								<p>
									Note: the regression coefficients do not correlate to the overall impact if
									only the most impactful portion is selected! the regression model would need
									to be rebuilt with only said features present (Sharma, 2023c).
								</p>
								<p>
									Once these features are discerned, analysis could take place. Due to the
									real-time nature of Uber, the online segment used in Michelangelo’s
									data-stores could be consistently used to test the model (Hermann, 2017).
								</p>
								<p>
									As is already done by Uber, a portion of the predictions will be withheld
									and if the classification accuracy – utilising ROC curves - models; or the
									regression coefficients drastically change in comparison to the real-time
									data – a more recent portion of data could be retrieved to retrain the ML
									model (Sharma, 2023c; Sharma, 2023e; Hermann, 2017).
								</p>
							




								<h3>3.7 User Experience</h3>
								<p>
									If the ML model discerns that a certain driver has delivered poor quality
									rides for a set duration of time, it could reduce the number of jobs or the
									rating of riders that appear for a portion of time.
								</p>
								<p>
									Based on the outputs from the ML model, clear communication could be
									conveyed to both riders and drivers on the states of their pickups. If the
									model predicts that the time to arrive has changed to be far longer than
									previously anticipated, then riders could be informed via a message.
								</p>
								<p>
									Post journey – if the driver is associated with a high quality pickup
									experience value, they could be offered far more jobs for the rest of the
									day, while a customer with a similar value may be targeted for promotions
									and deals.
								</p>
