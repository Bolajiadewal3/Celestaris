The rules of the lens rule the same for all lenses,
The airs of the soul dare not combat said flow.
United in ways not once spoken by all,
The rules doth dictate that all rays could hit home.

One's atma is fixed, or so one perceives,
Deceived by the self that the core yields no change.
So far from the truth,
The atom is dogma,
While the prism, the lens, has one constant: it wanes.

As one sees, one knows, one hears and such shifts,
Is one's knowledge transfixed if both senses conflict?
This journey, that path, those pavings of pain,
Does one's proprio-pores leave misleadings on frames.

Could equations grant solace,
Could expressions give grace.
Once the ray hits the pane,
Pain is scattered, some saved.

While one's sense of the passage,
Of rays seem perpetual.
Shown effects do diminish,
While soul's shape stays contextual.
