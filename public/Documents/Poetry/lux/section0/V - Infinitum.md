# V - Infinitum
*Enough I have heard, either cease or commit,
Lay your thoughts out bare or I shall wince at your visage,
I grow tired of you miser, your breath pains my ears,
Speak now or speak never, your silence saves tears.*

Frustration felt fierce, convincing 'tis so,
Simple, succint, will be the next flow.
All life and its wonders, downturns and depths:
Mere rays as if light, mere lines of pasts spent.
Did this black hold a normal, a surface to dent,
The void held no cruelty, yet let rays pass meant,
Meant to be loved, or hated, or scorned,
So when the black yielded blue, that surface birthed horns.
Curves of said light, curves of lives lived, deflected to others through actions and wisdom.
The black birthed itself, contradictions in all,
Gave weight from mere solace,
Now a mirror, or wall.
