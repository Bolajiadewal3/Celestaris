# VII - Fleeting
The young mare has abandoned this quest for quiescence,
Choosing instead to be clouded by crows,
Noise-makers and shakers once pondered real prose,
Priorities in youth do still baffle the old.

Alas, from nothing has come: **the lens**.

The black has birthed blue, the void now pretends,
To be nothing, when north rays be shrouded once south,
The lens of one's being, manifest. Bold.

How does one deem holy, this pure divination,
When time does corrupt and leave crude its make,
Should one deem wholly, this awakened ruination,
When time hides intentions; could hide cruel babes.

See now:
Conflicting,
States unseen,
Failed futures; fast fortunes,
Rakes, or deans.

Guess nothing, know some, live first then find function,
To map scraps of knowledge. And find solace in something.
